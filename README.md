# Problem Statement

Mental Workload is the amount of mental capacity needed to complete any given task. Stress, worry, and other mental tiredness can be lessened with the aid of mental workload measurement. In the domains of education, driving, air traffic control, and healthcare, Mental Workload is a key player. Several methods are investigated in this research to categorize the workload. Depending on how well various topics complete the mental task, the workload is divided into low and medium mental workload categories. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are employed for workload classification. CNN yields an accuracy rate of about 91%.

Labels -  0 and 1, where 0 is low workload and 1 is medium workload

# Code from scratch

The folder perceptron code code from scratch contains the code we experimented in lab. 

To run this code run:
```
python main.py
``` 

# Pytorch Code

**Some of the code for this project is referenced from https://www.learnpytorch.io/05_pytorch_going_modular/**

To run this code run
```
python train.py
```

If you want to use "fft" or "pca" data change it in the constants.py file:

FOR PCA
``` PREPROCESSED = "pca" ```

FOR FFT
``` PREPROCESSED = "fft" ```

And if you want to change any hyperparameters change it in constants.py file
